Plugin for CudaText.
Adds panel "Terminal" to the bottom panel of CudaText. It is emulation of terminal, Bash by default. You can enter commands in this terminal, and see usual output.

Plugin uses OS shell: Bash (on Unix) or Cmd.exe (Windows).
Currently no command prompt of shell is shown, and no colors are shown.

Plugin has several options in .ini file - call menu item Options/ Settings-plugins/ Terminal/ Config.

In the input field, arrow-down key shows menu of last entered commands.
