Plugin for CudaText.
Adds panel "Terminal" to the bottom panel of CudaText. It is emulation of terminal, Bash by default. You can enter commands in this terminal, and see usual output.

Plugin uses OS shell: Bash (on Unix) or Cmd.exe (Windows).
Currently no command prompt of shell is shown, and no colors are shown.

Plugin has several options in the .ini file - call menu item Options/ Settings-plugins/ Terminal/ Config.

Hotkeys in the terminal:
- arrow down: show last commands (history) menu
- Esc: close terminal and focus editor
- Break: interrupt/restart shell process
